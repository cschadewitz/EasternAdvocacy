    <h2>Find Local Legislative Representatives</h2>
</header>
<p>Here you can enter any portion of your address and find your local legislative representatives. Our search method uses geographical location, so only specifying Washington will provide the legislators from the geographical center of the state, not all of Washington. We do store the information you choose to share in order to speed up future searches but otherwise we do not use the information you provide.</p>
